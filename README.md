# spinget

Download show audio from WXOX spinitron.


## How to run

1. Install requests:
    
     pip3 install requests
    
2. Get show audio, eg:

    ./spinget.py 11/04/2021 00:00 1

The above invocation gets `1` hour of audio starting at midnight (`00:00`) on
November 4th, 2021 (`11/04/2021`).

Note that this probably will not work properly across a date boundry.
